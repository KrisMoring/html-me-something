				<h2>Finding My Way</h2>
				<p>I was raised Christian.  We went to a Methodist church.  I went to sunday school.  Overall it was fairly laid back.  At some point, I guess when I was smart enough and had enough knowledge, I started to question how much sense it all made.  Stories of walking on water and coming back from the dead were impossible to believe.  It also didn't seem possible for one religion to be right and all the others to be wrong.  I never really went to anyone looking for answers.  My parents, grandparents and many other family members were Christians and I could tell from the few times the subject did come up that they couldn't explain any of the things that didn't make sense to me.  
				</p>
				<p>Eventually I did discuss God/Faith/Religion with my friends.  When I started partying, we would often discuss or debate different points of view.  I always tried to keep an open mind and if someone made a point that I hadn't thought of and agreed with I would acknowledge it.  On the other hand, if someone said something that didn't make sense, especially if it involved discrediting science, I was happy to explain what they were wrong about and why.  With science being based strictly on evidence, it obviously makes more sense than anything that is not based on evidence.  During this time I learned a lot and gained a lot of understanding about my personal beliefs.  I didn't feel like the reality of scienctific knowledge disproved religion necessarily but I definitely did not agree with most religious beliefs or feel that any religion in particular made any more sense that any other.  I wondered if i would be considered Atheist but it didn't seem quite right.  I knew I did't believe in the divinity of Jesus Christ or Heaven or Hell but I wasn't comfortable saying "There is no God."  I don't believe in what most people of faith would call God but  the definition of God seems to vary so much that it's hard to say anything for sure other than "I Don't Know."  After years of knowing what I believe and what I don't believe or simply don't know, I started hearing the term Agnostic.  I knew it had something to do with non-religion and finally decided to google it.  I realized for the first time that my acknowledgement of unknowing was fairly common and was called Agnostic.

				<h2>Now That I Know (That I Don't Know)</h2>
				<p>I've been with my wife since I was twenty and she was eighteen.  She was raised without any religious influence.  We did get married in the church I went to growing up and we have gonethere with my parents a handful of times over the years including some with out three children.  The older two have gone to sunday school a few times so they were at least introduced to Christianity and God but we haven't made it a point to teach them to be Christian.  That's not to say we haven't taught them morals.  My wife and I both consider ourselves to be good people and have taught our children the importance of good behavior, good manners, honesty, what is fair, what is right, etc.  I think those things are much more important than the specifics of religion.  I do however have plenty of respect for religion when used in a positive way, such as a source of comfort or a source of strength.  What I don't have respect for is when people use religion as an insurance policy or as a way to ignore or hide immoral behavior.
				</p>	
				<p>Although I still enjoy discussing/debating religion and faith, I try to be careful about commenting on these subjects.  I can be a bit of a smart-ass and its so easy to poke fun at religious beliefs that I see plenty of opportunities to do so.  However, I don't want to disrespect anyone so I usually keep it to myself if I'm around people I don't know that well.  If I'm around people I know and it comes up, I am eager to hear their opinions and share my own.  If I find that someone wants to talk about it, although I remain respectful, I don't hold back.  I rarely find any opinions that differ from mine that are based on reason or logic.  I try to get people to put aside beliefs that they have strictly because they grew up with them, and to look at things from a logical and reasonable standpoint.  This usually leaves them a choice between acknowleding that I have a good point and ending the conversation.</p>
